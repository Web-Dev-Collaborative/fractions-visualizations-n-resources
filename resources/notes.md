#### What is a fraction?

> Fractions are used to represent smaller pieces (or parts) of a whole.

**The parts might make up one thing, or more than one thing. Either way, altogether, they make up what's called a whole.**

It's important to note that a whole can mean more than one thing. It's useful to think of a sweet shop as an analogy. For sharing a singular whole amount, you can think of a chocolate bar, a cake bar, or muffin. For grouping an amount into fractional parts, you can imagine a bag of sweets -- there are lots of sweets in the bag, but you need all of them to make up the whole bag.

#### What is a child friendly definition of a fraction?

A simple definition of a fraction for children is:

> A fraction is any part of a group, number or whole.

#### What are the parts of a fraction?

A fraction has three parts. They are:

The numerator which is the number above the bar.

The denominator which is the number below the bar.

The vinculum which is the bar separating the two numbers.

#### What is a unit fraction?

A unit fraction with 1 as its numerator (top number), and a whole number for the denominator (bottom number).

#### What is a non-unit fraction?

A non-unit fraction is a fraction with a number greater than one as its numerator (top number) and a whole number for the denominator (bottom number).

#### Using objects to visualise fractions

When you're starting out with teaching children fractions, objects or pictures of objects are a great way to understand how they work.

Start with concrete items, like food or counters -- you can use pasta pieces or dried beans in place of counters -- then draw them as pictures.

Once you've got this down, you can move onto using rational numbers (the fancy name for fractions) to represent them. Learning fractions in this order makes it easier to work out fractions of natural numbers later on.

The most important thing to remember when you're dealing with fractions is to go slow.

There's so much information to process! Even if something seems easy, take the extra time to really understand the basic concepts behind fractions. It will make life a lot easier when you come to more complex problems that involve converting between fractions, decimals and percentages later on.

#### Examples of fractions in everyday life

You may not even notice, but fractions are all around us! Some examples of everyday fractions include:

- Splitting a bill at a restaurant into halves, thirds or quarters
- Working out price comparisons in the supermarket when something is half price
- Figuring out amounts in the kitchen, for example a recipe could serve 10 people but there are only 4 eating, and this means you'll need fractions to figure out the correct amount
- Adding up monetary amounts
- Looking at time! Half an hour and quarter past are both common things to hear where time is concerned!

#### Why are fractions so tricky in primary school maths?

In the first years of school, you learn how numbers work. You learn how to count, and that the number 1 is equal to one object, 2 is equal to two objects, and so on.

You learn that when you count up, the numbers have more value. And then, just when you think you've got the hang of numbers, you learn that there are other types of numbers out there, like fractions.

As a child, you are still making sense of the world. So when you learn a set of rules (like how to count with positive whole numbers), you hold onto them. The problem? When you come across things that don't fit the rules, it's much harder to understand.

Positive whole numbers (like 1, 2 or 65) are simple. They gain more value as they go up, and they always mean the same thing (1 always means 1, and 2 always means 2). They are also known as natural numbers. Fractions are known as rational numbers, and they follow different rules.

To cut a long story short, understanding how to do fractions can be tricky for primary school children.

Fractions don't always mean the same thing. ½ of a cake is not the same as ½ of three cakes, or ½ of a bag of 12 sweets! That's the first hurdle -- the value of a fraction changes depending on how big the numerator (top number) is. Secondly, if the bottom number (the denominator) in a fraction gets bigger, the value decreases. On top of all of that, names for fractions don't always sound like the number they represent, like an eighth for ⅛ or a quarter for ¼.



Ask "If you want to cut this into four pieces, how many cuts do you need to make?" The answer will be three cuts. Answer for them (show by cutting or show the places where you would cut) Announce you are dividing the string.

Ask "If you want to cut the string into three pieces, how many cuts do you need to make?" Let them figure it out, the answer is two cuts.

Ask them "If you want to divide the string in half, thus, cut it into two pieces, where would you divide, or cut, the string" The answer is one single cut.

Now then, have them generalize the algorithm of n pieces of string is achieved with (n-1) number of cuts. For example you might say "So, if I wanted to divide this string into 56 pieces, how many cuts do I need to make?" At this point most will say proudly, "55!" and feel good about being smart. The other half will catch on, pause for discussion, let the smart half of kids educate the slower half of the group. Show using a table:

pieces | cuts\
-----------------\
4 3\
3 2\
2 1\
56 55

Now they're ready for some deep thinking. say "That's all fine and good. But what if I want to take a piece of string and have ONE piece."

The wheels will really start to spin in their brains. At this point you need to let them arrive at the only logical conclusion. Zero cuts (n-1) or NOT cutting will result in a single piece of string. There may be some good discussion generated and argument about is a "no-cutting action" a cut. That's a good thing to have in class.

pieces | cuts\
-----------------\
4 3\
3 2\
2 1\
56 55\
1 0

So now you are finally ready to discuss division by zero. Say "We've talked about dividing to get 4, dividing to get 3, dividing into 2 half pieces, and even dividing by 1." You may write or show them "1 ÷ 4, 1 ÷ 3, 1 ÷ 2" They will get the idea that to get n number of pieces, it's (n-1) number of cuts. Even 1 piece from zero cuts will work. They will accept zero = no cuts. Ask "How many cuts will result in ZERO PIECES of string"

pieces | cuts\
---------------------------\
4 3\
3 2\
2 1\
56 55\
1 0\
0 ??

You might get some kid say "negative 1?" and some kids will say "not possible" You can say and/or write out "Then so what you mean to say is this: "1 ÷ 0" is not possible.

Class say: "oooooohhhhhhhh!! yeaaaahhhhh."

This way they develop the intuition that it's not the "act" of division that is impossible, it's the "result" that is impossible.
